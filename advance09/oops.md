# 1. Does javascript have classes?

# Yes, JavaScript has introduced class syntax as part of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to make it easier to work with object-oriented programming concepts.

# Although javascript is prototype based language.

# JavaScript's class syntax is mostly syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance system  .

#  The class syntax provides a more familiar and cleaner syntax for those coming from other object-oriented programming languages like c++,java  etc. 

# 2. What is OOP?

# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects" to organize and structure code.

# As we know Javascript is a prototype based language and not a class-based language. But still we can apply some oop principles here.  

# 3. What is object?

# Object is nothing but a collection of properties and methods.

# 4. Why we need oop?

# In simple words, OOP provides a way to structure and organize the code and it eradicated the spagetthi code (messed up code).

# 5. Parts of oop in JS?

 -- Object Literal (A literal object)
 -- Constructor Function
 -- Classes
 -- Instances (new,this...etc)

 # 6. 4 pillars of OOP?

 -- Abstration
 -- Encapsulation
 -- Inheritence
 -- Polymorphism
