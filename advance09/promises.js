// What is Promise in js

// "Producing code" is code that can take some time

//"Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

// A promise is an object that links the producing code and  consuming code.

// A javascript promise is an object of 3 states

// ===> Pending --> While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined. then()
// ===> Fulfilled ---> When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value. finally()
// ===> Rejected ---> When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object. catch()
